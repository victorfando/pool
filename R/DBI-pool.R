#' Release a connection back to the pool
#'
#' A wrapper around \code{poolReturn(conn)}. Unlike its namesake in DBI,
#' in the context of the \code{pool} package, \code{dbDisconnect} does
#' not close the connection and free the associated resources. Rather,
#' it simply returns the connection back to pool, which then decides
#' whether to keep it around or actually destroy it.
#'
#' @param conn A DBIConnection object previously fetched from the pool.
#' @param ... Not in use.

## Ideally this would also reset the connection more fully (ex: reset
## all user-defined variables set with `SET` back to their default values).
## Currently, there isn't a handy dbResetConnection() generic in DBI, so
## this functionality is not yet here. Until then, our reccomendation is
## that, if you absolutely need to set variables, or somehow modify the
## connection's defaults, you might not want to use the pool package. It
## won't stop you, but it does mean that the next time you fetch a connection,
## you'll never be sure if this is a brand new connection with the default
## settings OR a connection that you have previsouly returned to pool
## AFTER you changed the defaults...
